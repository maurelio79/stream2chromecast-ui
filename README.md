# stream2chromecast-ui
Simple pygtk ui for stream2chromecast

<p>Just a simple UI to use the beautifull stream2chromcast script that you can find here:<br />
https://github.com/Pat-Carter/stream2chromecast</p>
<p>In order to work, for the moment, stream2chromecast folder must be in /opt, of course you can change
the script as you prefer.</p>
